# 👨‍🎓 About	

**Dinghan Wang** is a 2nd-year master student in Control Science and Engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University. My research interest includes: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Intelligent Systems, UAV, Robotics, Control Systems, Game Theory. 

Outside of my academic life, I am an aviation enthusiast and geek. I grew up in Harbin, a beautiful city in the northeast of China. 

Please find my **CV [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)**.

**I am currently finding a PhD position suitable for me.**
